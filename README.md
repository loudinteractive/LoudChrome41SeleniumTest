# LoudChrome41SeleniumTest
This tool took 95,196 of PowerReviews’ JS powered ‘Display 4’ review URLs and rendered them in the Chrome 41-based crawler. Then, it checked for the presence of the PowerReviews CSS classes, indicating the reviews were present in the page’s DOM and could be indexed. The test showed that PowerReviews review content, populated via JS, is properly rendered for Googlebot.
